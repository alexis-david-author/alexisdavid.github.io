    <h1>Luna Moth</h1>

    <div class="poem">
little steps out from my shell
the one I ate and brought me hell
I had a hunger in me
so I chewed the leaves of your sweet gum,
your walnut, and your hickory
and you became essential
I was suffused with your potential
when I define myself I start with you
my love became desire
and that desire only grew

if you were a word 
you would be always on my lips
and you would taste like dark red cherries
dressed in your little Freudian slips
and I would think about you daily
just as I think you now
you are the balm that soothes my aching wounds
you are the kiss upon my brow
the one that never graced my skin
because our distance won’t allow

you are off to college
I am “working on myself”
the silk is hardening around my body 
as it dies a hundred times
that zombied state it made me godly
now I’m forced to be alive
a new body grew
from the old one that had withered
all this time away from you
I have spent begging, undelivered

and now I must emerge
for if I wait until I’m ready
I will never leave this place
at least my wings are somewhat steady
I adjust these lacy sails
so I can fly right back to you
I try to smile when you greet me
but my mouth it will not move
it has not developed and so it cannot consume
and it hits me suddenly

my love,
I will never know the taste of you
